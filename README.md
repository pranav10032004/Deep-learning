# Deep-learning
Deep learning Introduction:
1. Deep learning is defines about to working on complex neural networks. This topic is subset of the Machine Learning
Types of Layers in Deep Learning:
1. Input Layer:
   Recives the raw data to the machine

2. Hidden Layer:
   Perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data

3. Output Layer:
   Provide the final output and prediction on classification

Activation function in deep learning:

1. ReLU : Rectified Liner unit:
   which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.

2. Sigmoin:
   Map the values binary (0 and 1 in the layer).

3. softmax:
   convert the raw data in to (Score) convert into the probability on the given data.

   Back propogation and optimisation :
   In this propogation step we use some of the example -mse(mean standard error) , cross entropy stop: which are optimises the data.
